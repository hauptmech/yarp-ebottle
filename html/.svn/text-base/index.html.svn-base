<h2><a class="anchor" name="Introduction">
Introduction</a></h2>
The idea of this project came out when we were testing YARP for communicating different proccess. We realised that, for large data transmission such as images, the execution time was surprinsingly huge, even if we were working in a single computer.<p>
Another test, with smaller data but with a high frequency requirement was made and again we found the same problem.<p>
We discovered that one of the critic points where the program spent most of the time was at the assigment operator, that is, the copy method.<p>
After make some consults to YARP developers, they told us tha Bottles and Values were not designed for efficient transmission but for human readable data purposes.<p>
We decided, as YARP debelopers suggest us, to reimplement the Bottle and Value classes in order to make copy method and data transmission faster and more efficient.<p>
We present here a new implementation which is more efficient and tries to keep all the compatibility with the original Bottles.<p>

 This figure shows a comparative of the execution time (in seconds) of a program that simply makes assignments between bottles of different sizes.<h2><a class="anchor" name="Usage">
Usage</a></h2>
To use this implementation you do not have to change your source code in a dramatic way. The only requirement is to include the <a class="el" href="compatibility_8h.html">compatibility.h</a> file at the top most of all the files that uses YARP Bottles and Values. Then, using a preprocessor flag EBOTTLE defined in this header, the Bottle implementation used can be switched very easyly.<h2><a class="anchor" name="Feedback">
Feedback</a></h2>
We have implemented many of the functionality that the original Bottle and Value clasess have. Our tests work with both implementations, with a difference in the efficiency. But some of you may need other funcitonality offered by the original Bottle that we have not implemented. Please, let us know and we will consider to include it.<p>
Furthermore, if you find any bug that we have not discovered, contact us in order to solve the problem. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Jun 16 11:59:03 2008 for URUS by&nbsp;
